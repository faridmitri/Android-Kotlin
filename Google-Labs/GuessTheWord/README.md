GuessTheWord. It is a word guessing app you can play with one or more friends. To play, hold the device in landscape, facing away from you with your thumbs on the Skip and Got It buttons. Your friends can then give you clues to help you guess the word. If you get the word right, press Got It. If you're stuck, press Skip. You will modify the app to use Architecture components and best practices.
